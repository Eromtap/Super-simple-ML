# Super-simple-ML
I made a machine learning thing to help those who may be struggling.
OK, so heres the deal. I've been working with ML for awhile. Ive used Numpy, Pandas, Scikit learn, tensor etc and something occured to me....
I've never actually written a machine learing algorithm from scratch. Just for fun, I decided to give it a go.
In doing so, i wanted to create something simple that anyone struggling to understand the concepts could grasp and hopefully help them along.
In this project, there is no calculus, no back propogation, no linear algebra. In fact, the only python libraries used are random and csv.
The only math is some simple addition and multiplication.
I also wanted to see if I could create something i which the inputs acted as inputs and weighted nodes and make it work.
No hidden layers whatsoever and to my surprise, it actually works lol.
I dont know if one could really call this a neural network, but thats what I called it and it's staying lol. It is undoubtedly machine learning however.
I was surprised at how simple I could make this project and have it actually work. It's not elegant, it's not pretty, but dammit it works.
For anyone wanting to get a handle on some of the basic principles of ML and doing so in the absolute simplest way imaginable, I encourage you to check this out.
While this is a simple project, I found that I quite like some of the things I stumbled on and am going to explore them further.
I left all my notes and frustrated comments in the code. I hope these will serve to both enlighten and entertain. They clearly show my thought processes.
